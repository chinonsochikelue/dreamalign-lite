# DreamAlign Lite - AI-Powered Career Development Platform

## Introduction

In today's rapidly evolving job market, professionals struggle to identify their true career potential and prepare effectively for opportunities. Career guidance is often generic, expensive, and disconnected from individual aspirations. Interview preparation lacks personalized feedback, and career path exploration feels overwhelming without proper direction.

## Problem Statement

Modern professionals face critical challenges in their career development journey:

- **Unclear Career Direction**: Many professionals feel stuck, unsure of which career path aligns with their passions, skills, and values

- **Interview Anxiety**: Lack of realistic practice environments and personalized feedback leads to poor interview performance
- **Skill Gap Uncertainty**: Professionals don't know which skills to develop or which courses to take for their desired career path
- **Limited Access to Mentorship**: Quality career coaching and interview preparation are expensive and inaccessible to most professionals
